                            Hello! I'm Rafay Ahmed, a self-driven and deeply curious developer passionate about building meaningful digital experiences. My journey into software began with a spark of interest and quickly evolved into a focused mission â€” to master full-stack development while aligning my work with higher values and purpose.

                            I specialize in JavaScript, particularly with frameworks like React for frontend development, and I'm building a growing proficiency in Node.js and backend technologies. One of my proudest creations so far is Kitabo, a feature-rich Discord bot ecosystem that reflects both my technical skill and my desire to create tools that serve communities.
